# Healthcare AI Dashboard | Antony's Precision Patient Risk Analytics Project

## Overview

This project is a sophisticated single-page web application simulating a healthcare AI dashboard developed by Antony, an aspiring software engineer. It demonstrates how AI-driven analytics and data visualization can solve real-world healthcare challenges by helping medical professionals prioritize patient care based on personalized risk scores.

The dashboard showcases core concepts relevant to enterprise AI in healthcare, including patient data management, risk prediction simulation, and interactive insights—all aligned with the vision and requirements highlighted by Sand Technologies' graduate program.

 **Patient Data Management:**  
  Displays a searchable and filterable patient list with key information such as age, medical condition, risk scores, and risk levels (Low, Medium, High).

- **Personalized Patient Risk Analytics:**  
  Simulates AI-driven risk scoring that evolves over multiple visits to track patient health trends.

- **Interactive Risk Trend Visualization:**  
  Real-time charts powered by Chart.js visualize patient risk score trajectories across their visit history.

- **Simulation of New Patient Visits:**  
  A “Simulate New Visit” feature generates updated risk scores and notes, reflecting dynamic patient monitoring and treatment effectiveness.

- **Accessible and Responsive UI:**  
  Designed for ease of use on desktop and smaller screens with keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for accessibility.

## Project Purpose and Impact

This project models a healthcare AI system designed to address pressing challenges such as healthcare professional shortages, fragmented patient records, and delayed diagnosis/treatment. The real-time risk scoring simulation and interactive visualization help healthcare providers:

- Prioritize high-risk patients for timely intervention.
- Monitor patient progress over time with AI-driven insights.
- Enable data-informed treatment adjustments through dynamic analytics.

The solution reflects how data and AI technologies can empower smarter, more personalized healthcare delivery—aligned with Sand Technologies' focus on impactful enterprise AI.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-world clinical datasets and bioinformatics.
- Enhance AI simulation with machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Add patient demographic filters, medication history, and treatment plans.
- Implement role-based access for doctors, nurses, and admin users.
- Add exportable reports and PDF summary generation.
- Connect with backend APIs for data persistence and live updates.
